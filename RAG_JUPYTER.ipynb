    "\n",
    "1. **R - Retrieval**\n",
    "   - We loaded documents (PDF)\n",
    "   - We split them into chunks\n",
    "   - We created embeddings and stored them in ChromaDB\n",
    "   - We searched for the most relevant chunks for each question\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A - Augmentation**\n",
    "   - We combined the found documents with the question\n",
    "   - We created a prompt with context for the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **G - Generation**\n",
    "   - We sent the prompt to the LLM\n",
    "   - The model generated a response based on the context\n",
